# Backend-API


Learning backend web development - NodeJs, Express, bcrypt, mongoose, morgan

I am now learning JavaScript. So far I have made a very basic (ugly) webpage to display and practice on. I have set up the logging in and registering of a user although very basic I intend to update as my knowledge grows. The program checks for email already existing inside the database before creating new user.

There is also a contact form which sends an automated email to said set email with the information.
